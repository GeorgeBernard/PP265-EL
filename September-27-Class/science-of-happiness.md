# The surprising science of happiness

## Nature gave us a big brain
- Weird structures
- Frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex)
- Can simulate the future (consequence analyzer)

## Pop Quiz - Lottery or Parapalegic
- Happiness of data (both are just as happy one year later)
- Impact Bias (overestimate effect of future events)

## Happiness can be synthesized
- Psychological immune system that changes your views of the world in order to
  make you happier about it
- Many people have objectively shitty experiences
- But we all roll our eyes at the synthesized happiness

## Experimental Paradigm
1. Bring in six objects
2. Rank them from most liked to least liked
3. "We happen to have #3 and 4, which one would you want?"
4. Have them rank the items again, they like the ones they picked more

### Tried the above with amnesic people
- After ranking, they ask which one they picked in the last round
- Even then they liked better the one they got, even though they don't own it
- It is just as valid, their mind literally changed without "fox and the
  grapes"

## Freedom and it's effects
- Freedom is friend of natural happiness
- Freedom is enemy of synthetic happiness
- **Serenity Prayer**

## "Tis nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so" - Shakespeare
