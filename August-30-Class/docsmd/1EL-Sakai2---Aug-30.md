***Assignment and Discussion Comments:***

**I will post all materials for Thursday’s class on Sakai by Monday evening.**

*The course design*

-   Most of our weekly class topics are organized as two different sessions as if we met twice a week. However, the assignments are consolidated to make it easier for you.

-   The assignment “Topics” are often a good guideline as to how the class will be structured.

-   Each weekly class will have a separate folder in the Sakai Resources section. This folder will include an *Assignment and Discussion Comments* memo like this one and class-related notes, forms, and memos. The class-related notes, forms, and memos will include: materials posted before class; materials handed out in class; and materials posted the day after class. I will clarify the differences between “review,” “read,” and “scan” in class.

-   Note additional assignments for Sunday. I may add time sensitive assignments after class on an exception basis.

-   The assignments for Thursday’s class are typical of other classes. The variety of materials reflects an emphasis on thinking and learning about multiple practical and open-ended enterprising leadership issues.

*Short paper assignment: *

Please respond to the three prompts in one paper (maximum two pages, double spaced). Put some real thought into these prompts. Be specific. However, the “opportunity or problem” prompt only requires a specific definition, not a specific enterprising idea. Also, it does not need to apply to all Duke seniors. This short paper will not be graded.

Email your paper to me (<abrown@duke.edu>) by **9:00am Thursday**. We will use some of this information in our class.

*Review assignments:  
*The two Ted Talks are interesting and relevant to Thursday’s class. In watching each of them, define the core idea/messages and then develop your own opinion. Discern the relevance to Thursday’s class topics and this course. Ditto for the Brooks op-ed (posted on Sakai).
