# Givers vs. Takers

Moments of both

Test: I'm not a narcissist
Not all takers are narcissists

Most people are matchers, some of both in equal

Worst performers were givers

Self identify as giver

Givers make organizations better i.e. teamwork makes the dream work

Best performance is matchers

Game Theory, tit for tat is dominant against a lot of strategies

1. Givers get burnout, need to value them
2. Encourage help-seeking, okay to be a receiver as well
3. Get the right people on the bus (Keep the wrong people off the bus)

Agreeable is not giver, givers may not be nice, no correlation

Success is about a contribution

Pronoia is the delusion that people behind your back are plotting your success

# Takeaway
Be a giver, but if you encounter takers, kick em out, a la tit for tat
