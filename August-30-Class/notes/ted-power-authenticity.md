# The Power of Authenticity

Consider yourself liars (I have lied, ergo I am a liar)

Where are we being inauthentic

Bought his own book and lied, not malicious just bad habit of massaging the
truth

Authenticity is about realness

Some people think their opinions are facts

Something beyond honesty, is courage to be vulnerable

Iceberg exercise, "If you really knew me, you'd know this about me"

When it comes from below the waterline it's vulnerable

When we have the courage to get real, amazing things happen

Introduce with most meaningful moment to establish realness

It inspires people

# Takeaway
Be authentic, and surround yourself with authentic people
