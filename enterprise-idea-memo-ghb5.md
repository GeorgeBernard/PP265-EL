# Enterprising Idea Memo

## Outline
My enterprising idea is to facilitate games that help us interact more intimately.

A sizable corpus of research suggests that hurtful behavior or language can be
tempered by relating and including in your life those with different
identities, perspectives, and personal stories.

This is important because, for me, this has been deeply true in my personal
journey.

The key strategy here is to minimize the barriers to authentic relation through
incentives, i.e. free snacks, beverages, and gamification

The outcomes I hope to manifest are a greater degree of connection within the
nightly members, and as a result a greater appreciation for their stories.

My closing comment is to invite two of you up here to play

## Establish Principles

1. Honor Yourself
2. Lean into your edge
3. Everything is confidential

## Play Noticing Game
