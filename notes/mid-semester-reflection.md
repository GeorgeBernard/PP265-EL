# Intro

This document should break down the progress I have made towards the course
outcomes on an item by item basis. I'll list each outcome from the summary
sheet, and document my progress on it as well as plans moving forward to
address deficiencies in my approach. 

# Knowledge

Within this domain, I feel that this class has given me the lexicon to address
a lot of these issues in a structural way. 

## Personal clarity, synthesis, and perspective

- Moral fiber
    - The readings, anecdotes, and conversations have given me the intellectual
      matrix on which I can crystallize my thoughts on moral development and
fiber
    - Overall I feel that my knowledge is at the point where I can approach the
      leadership map summary of my moral fiber with confidence.
- Values
    - I feel that the class and reading on "Success" were very elucidating for
      me. It provided yet another framework that could start my enumerating
      what success means to me, and why I want to pursue it.
    - I feel like I need to do more worksheets in this area in order to
      complete the relevant section of my leadership map. I still have
      ambiguity about my non-moral values that I need to suss out before attempting a
      self consistent write-up of my value structure. 
- Worldview
    - The section on worldview and governance structure was, for me at least,
      muddled in what we wanted to be a *perfect view* of how the world should
      be structured and what a *perfect citizen* was.
- Talents/competencies
    - I feel like this section is going to be under continual development in
      the second half of the course.

## Leadership 

I feel that we have not necessarily covered these topics in great
depth so far in the course. Moving forward, I'm excited to approach these in
practice for the last several classes of the course. 

- Leadership and moral fiber paradigms and models
- Meanings of leadership and key PPS265s leadership principles
- Essence of leadership development
- Leadership and course topic “nuggets” and behaviors

# Critical Analysis Skills and Habits

## Analysis tools/processes: 

- Analysis & action process (get ready-go-get set)
    - I love how the emphasis is on **enterprising**, i.e. that the focus is on
      what can happen **right now**. 
    - It's flipped the script on traditional analysis and working loop with a
      focus on incremental improvement.
- Problem definitions and change models
    - This has been useful practice in isolating problems
    - I've even applied this framework in interpersonal relationship goals to
      some success.
- Bystander ethical obligation analysis
    - The parable of the sadhu was gripping, and was a useful anecdote to build
      a conversation around moral duty and breaking down scenarios along the
situation, the problem, and the people.
- Evaluation models/processes
    - The biggest thing this class has given me is the time and motivation to
      address these fundamental issues at a deeper level.  

## Analysis and Application to Specific Situations

- Personal Commitments
    - I've actually applied and thought up quick problem definitions and change
      models to romantic relationship problems I have been having, and it has
      worked to give me enough objectivity to approach the problem and think of some
      novel solutions
- Know what itches
    - This class has helped me identify and categorize more situations that
      "itch" me, this has been vital in identifying where my actions do not
      live up to my ideals (i.e. my integrity)

# Social and Psychological Development

As said earlier, I have deep gratitude for being given the time and incentives
to engage with my own personal moral development in a structured and deliberate
way. While I don't feel like this course has deeply changed my moral structure,
I feel like it is giving me the time to hone it to a finer point, to distill my
core beliefs in the leadership map, and see where I implement it (and fail to)
in my community benefit project.

## Efficacy: Confidence and courage to act

- Leadership results
    - This is likely the biggest area of improvement for me
    - I know enough about myself that I often let things fester rather than
      "rip the band-aid"
    - I need to develop more integrity and maximize the overlap between my
      behavior and my ideals
- Personal development

## Identity: Values clarification and modification

Many of these have been addressed earlier in this document, but I will comment
on any that need to "topped up".

- Exercise leadership
- Moral fiber (integrity)
- Strong-hearted (compassion + values-based courage)
- Benefit creation
    - The community benefit project is the place I will be exercising this the
      most.
- Incremental change (small is beautiful) and ripples

## Agency: Motivation to act

This stands as the largest area of personal growth for me moving into at least
the next several **years** of my life. I'm not confrontational by nature, so
while I am comfortable with who I am in the dark, I am not comfortable with who
I am in mixed companies. I feel that I often sacrifice my ability to be
outspoken about my morals when it can endanger relationships. I act *without*
integrity in these situations. **I need to develop the moral courage to act
with integrity.**

- Changemaker
- Act with integrity
- Exercise moral courage
- Develop relationships

# Key Objectives and Outcomes Moving Forward

- Act with integrity (be true to myself) in my interpersonal relationships
    - Try to understand the root of this issue
    - Include this topic in my leadership map
- Drill down on my community benefit project and put to practice what I have
  been learning this semester
    - Act with discipline and focus to achieve incremental benefit
