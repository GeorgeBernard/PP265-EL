***Ethical Tech: Judge AI Training***

Build an Ethical Tech Leader exercise module for judges training at the Duke Law School to help train them how to assess artificial intelligence (AI) in emerging technology cases in the law. Perform general background research to identify the knowledge gaps specific to judicial assessment of technology in legal cases and design the Rubric for Empowering Ethical Tech policy making decisions. Then, build a focused interactive educational exercise to help train judges and clerks in how to assess and apply AI in cases. Partner with Duke and Duke Law to build this initial exercise in spring 2018, before deploying it to train judges at Duke Law this summer, likely during the summer workshops for judges.
