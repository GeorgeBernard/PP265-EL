**My most important suggestion to improve this course is…**

-   Share leadership map stories after paper due date. Front load one page map assignments. Assign chunks. More feedback. Assign semester long leadership map partner. More leadership map conversations in dialogue dinner near due date.

-   Midsemester nominations made class contribution appear forced.

-   Put assignments in single PDF

-   Give alumni guests prompts to as students and have the students discuss with their partners first. Loosens everyone up a bit.

-   Create GroupMe

-   Reduce the material and prioritize forms

**My most positive comment about the course is**… (Calibrate with course outcomes)

-   Alumni reinforce the value of writing the leadership map to important life decisions down the road.

-   Totally unique learning experience

-   With so many ideas flying around in so much to bring from generalities to specifics, moved from bouncing between different ideas, different ways of seeing reality, to this being normal and improved ability to rapidly process and reconcile ideas. Plus new frameworks.

-   Stronger clarity on values and acting with integrity.

-   Thought deeper about issues that would otherwise have thought about superficially.

-   Open, honest, challenging and respectful conversations.

31% the best

93% the best or in the top three

100% the best, in the top three, or better than average
