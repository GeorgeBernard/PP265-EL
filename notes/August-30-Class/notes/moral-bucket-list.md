# The Moral Bucket List

Some people are fundamentally good

Eulogy virtue vs. Resume virtue

We (dukies espec.) live for external achievement

Wonderful is made not born

## Humility Shift
- Be honest about your weakness
- Identify your core sin

## Self-Defeat
- Character is built through competition with our weaknesses

## The Dependency Leap
- Community and commitment build character

## Energizing Love
- Love that decenters you

## The Call Within The Call
- Listen to the call within your call to redouble your efforts

## The Conscience Leap
- Leap beyond utilitarian logic and crash through our own fears

Paul Tillich paraphrase "suffering introduces you to yourself and reminds you
that you are not the person you thought you were"

# Review
Seems like a good checklist, but kind of obvious-ish
