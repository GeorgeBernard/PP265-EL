# Implementation: 3-year plan

The next three years pose some interesting opportunities to me, and by
(completely random I assure you) happenstance turn out to be the longest I am
capable of planning.

Before I break down my mission statement, It's useful to break down the
opportunities coming in the next three years

- My first job as a data engineering focused programmer
- A brand new city with a sizable young population, Charlotte
- My girlfriend who is also going to be working in that same City
- Transition to having more free time by a clean separation of working and
  non-working life.  

In many ways this is like my previous work experience, indeed I took a semester
off before to work full time. I prototyped what it meant to be in a new town
away from my school, to deeply miss my friends from university, and to shift my
perspective around work so that I would not burn myself out overworking.

It's different now, I am placed before sprawling choices:

- How long should I work at my first job?
- Should I pursue higher education?
- Is my current romantic partner the person I want to spend the rest of my life
  with?
- What communities in Charlotte should I try to carve my place in?
- Is Charlotte even the right place for me?

This problem space is so open that I lack the computational resources to find
even locally optimal solutions. I must fall back on my values. I know that if I
make my decisions based on an honest evaluation against my values, that I will
not regret my choices made in these first three years out of school.

## 3-year Mission Statement

For my first three years out of school, I want to:

1. Begin and develop authentic connections with my coworkers and new friends in
   Charlotte
2. Maintain and develop those connections I have with my inner circle at Duke,
   in my family, and with my girlfriend
3. Learn and grow as much as I can as a software craftsman
4. Pivot from my intense focus on academic achievement to make benefits for the
   communities I find in Charlotte as well as my personal health

This distills down to the life-mission of community and craftsmanship, but it
adds a focus on fitness as an enabler for both of these.

## Leadership Development Objectives & Key Strategies

The objectives are relatively self evident from the 3-year mission, but there
are many strategies that represent the opportunities I have in my move to
Charlotte.  

### Strategies to Find Connection in Charlotte

1. Join user groups and meetups (i.e. professional development communities in
   tech)
2. Find communities of shared interests (board games, makerspaces, public
   gardens, etc.)
3. Engage with the Duke network in Charlotte
4. Authentically relate to my coworkers, going out of my
   way to make friends with them beyond the workplace.
5. Make friends of my friends' friends (i.e. leverage their networks)

### Strategies to Build my Fitness in Charlotte

1. Go to spin classes with my girlfriend
2. Find a friend that is interested in pursuing fitness to keep each other
   accountable
3. Prepare meals in advance to better portion sizes, save money, and make more
   time to be with friends on week nights.

### Strategies to Make Benefits in Charlotte

This deserves to be a little meatier than the other strategies. I am in the
extremely lucky position to be employed by a company that cares about making
local benefits in Charlotte. I can leverage their connections to non-profits in
the area and make benefits for them using my skillset. So many groups have
amazing knowledge and expertise of the problems facing them, but lack a
quantitative skill set to store and handle their data. My company would provide
me with expertise and advice on how to serve these organizations in my own
time. 

This strategy hits a lot of my success kaleidoscope: Benefits, Connection, and
Craftsmanship (Win, Win, Win).

### Strategies to Be a Better Craftsman at Tresata

1. Take advantage of my mentors at Tresata (a small, vertically integrated
   company)
    1. Debrief the design choices of their system from the original architects
    2. Learn about interacting with customers from the product team 
    3. Learn about the care and growing of a startup from the founders
2. Help others in their technical blockers wherever possible
    1. Mentor interns and new hires come the new wave in summer

## Key Issues, Decisions, and Plans

### Working at Tresata

While I am deeply excited and enthusiastic about my upcoming Job at Tresata,
there are key issues with the position. First, the compensation seems low for
equivalent work. The perspective from HR is that Tresata is a "meritocracy",
which is a red flag for me at least. Although it is not entirely true for my
team, the development team, the office is expected to be present from 8am to
6pm (10 hrs) every work day. This may mean a culture of overworking, but it may
mean a close community within my office. From what I can tell, many of my
coworkers routinely stayed late some evenings, but was this so bad? Many
employees came in between 9 and 10 in the morning.

The company culture at Tresata will be of decent importance to my next 3 years,
so understanding how I will carve my place in a way I can personally sustain is
fundamental to my success moving forward.

### New City, New Community

The next big issue is how to find connection in Charlotte. I have my work, the
Duke community in Charlotte, and my girlfriend's friendships as networks. I
will want to capitalize and find connection within those, but these each
provide an individual, perhaps biased, sampling of the underlying population.
If I am to seek out groups that challenge me to be a better person, I need to
seek out communities with the values I want to develop.

Charlotte, for lack of better words, seems *yuppie*. I know that if I don't
seek out the right people, moral people who challenge me to be more strong
hearted, I could slide into alright friendships with alright people. This is
not a moral judgment on those with other priorities. This is not a condemnation
of those who value corporate success as a primary goal. I only hope that I am
able to find those intentionally moral people that I have had the unique
pleasure of meeting here at Duke. We are all crooked timber, but I hope that I
can find others whom I can help and be helped in turn to stumble toward
betterment.

### If and When: After Tresata

With these in mind, I have to understand what is to happen at the precipice of
my next 3 years. This is extremely hypothetical, but there may come a time when
Tresata is unsustainable for me to continue working. After this point, what
should I do? I think I have a few options:

- Education
    - Business (mba)
    - Technical (masters or phd)
- Work
    - Private Sector Tech Company
    - A Non Tech Company in a Technical Role
    - Government Agency
    - Academic Research

Each of these has their own trade offs, and I am not at a place right now where I can
know what choice I would make. I can, however, speak to the difficulties that
would present when making that decision. In this choice I would be trying to
optimize across being close to my family, challenging myself in my work, and
how to hold on to the companions I build along my path.
