# Implementation: The next 3 seasons

Now we come down to brass tacks. Here I will outline the strategies and
opportuinities to face in my last semester at Duke and my move to Charlotte in
the Spring. I identify in the coming seasons is a process of refinement,
expansion, and refinement. I hope to focus in on my classes and friends at
Duke. Expand out to my work and new communities in Charlotte.

## Fall 2018

I write this section as of early November. I have two months, perhaps one real
month, left in my undergraduate career. I see, in not uncertain detail, how
they will lay themselves out. I feel, not a melancholy, but a nostalgia for my
Duke career. I will deeply miss the connections I made here, but I'm happy to
be moving to my next step in life. 

The question at hand, is what will make an excellent last semester at Duke.
Going into this semester, I wanted to see what I was capable of. I am part
timing, and I wanted to see how much I could learn if I put myself to it. I
found this unsustainable and perhaps learned my lesson. I need to be deep not
wide in my last month at duke. I need to tie up loose ends and try to maximize
my connection with my friends. I need to be a good housemate, a good friend,
and a good student in my last two classes. It is so easy to go wide here at
Duke, to try and take on so much responsibility, but I have been enamored with
those semesters where I wasn't stretching myself thin, where I was focused on
the people around me.

**My strategies for this last month are to do deep work in my classes and
maximize my time with my friends.**

## Winter 2019

This is when my work starts. January 17th is my start date. I want to hit the
ground running. The first two months at Tresata I will be a part of their
onboarding and training program, which will give me the time to build up my
skills and make productive contributions.

In order to best fulfill my goals, I want my days at Tresata to be broken down
as follows:

- From 8 to noon I will work
- At noon, for an hour I will use the company gym (hopefully with a coworker)
- At 1 pm I will take lunch with my coworkers
- from 2 to 6 pm I will work 

I hope that my strategy of splitting up my day and giving myself time in the
morning (while my will is strong) to exercise will help build the habits I want
to maintain well into my twenties.

Outside of this, I would like to take this time to probe the networks
available, get a sense of what the people are like in town, and see what
communities I would best fit and thrive in.

**In the first season of my career, my goal is to expand into the role of a
good software craftsman and survey the available communities in Charlotte**

## Spring 2019

The spring is predicated on the winter. I hope that by this point I will have
made strong friendships with my coworkers, my Duke alumni network, and at least
one tech professional or learning group.

After the winter of expansion, I want to see what pans out. That may seem glib,
but I mean it closer to the literal interpretation of the word "pan". My winter
should be spent surveying the land and gathering sediment, putting in the work
to mine relationships from the awkward territory of aquaintances. 

**The spring will be a time where I can pan out the sediment and search for those
golden nuggets: people I mesh with, who challenge me and help me and I help in
turn to be better.**
