  This document should function as a map, or snapshot, of where I am in my
  moral trajectory in the final semester of my Duke undergraduate career.
  Enabled by language and learning from this semester's course in Enterprising
  Leadership, I am able to codify my values, disect my actions, and establish
  plans for positive change in the near future as well as broader missions for
  the far future. 

  I am a service oriented person, with an intense desire to good for others. I
  often stumble on the path toward being better for others, and that failure is a
  fuel that drives me to make amends and do right moving forward. I love to make
  good things that help other accomplish their goals. I am a toolmaker and a
  motivator for others.
  
  This is best read in the order presented. Later sections refer to earlier
  ones, but don't let that stop you from jumping around the text.
