## Master your Craft

I mention this in my life mission, but it's worth going into why I value
mastering my craft. 

Making things feels good. It's visceral. The satisfaction at making a desk with
your hands and your tools. The joy of getting my system set up to convert this
leadership map from plain text documents into the format you see here right
now. Making things, even better if they solve a problem, is a shortcut to
direct achievement and satisfaction. 

I've made some cool stuff in my life:

- EMP generator that can shut off small electronics.
- Standing desk from pallet wood for my freshman dorm room 
- Programs to help my classmates with grunt work on our final projects
- Papercraft masks for halloween
- Metal and glass flower pot sculpture

These fulfill my creative urge. Literally the desire to create, but also the
desire to express myself. 

I've always enjoyed making things; I'm not sure where it originated. I can't
remember a time when I haven't enjoyed manipulating physical medium. Even in
grade school my art projects existed in physical space, penny nails on a wood
board adding texture to a water color.

When it comes to mastering my craft, I feel there's also an element of
recognition from my peers. I love making a creative product but the icing to
this cake is that community validation that comes from making something people
value.  

## Learn, Learn, Learn

Reportedly, this was the advice Lenin gave to young people, and it holds true
today. I have a deep curiosity and hunger for learning. It feels so good to
grapple with a novel concept. I enjoy more than anything sharing my knowledge
with others. I love seeing the glint of clarity and understanding in someone's
eyes just as much as experiencing it myself.

Beyond academic learning, I value self-knowledge. We harken back to the words
of Socrates: 

> The unexamined life is not worth living 

The benefits of self-awareness are many. To live in accordance with your
values, you must first know your values. This is not to say that I am a very
self aware person. Like so many areas of expertise, the less you have the more
likely you are to overestimate your ability. Suffice to say, I am just on the
cusp of self-awareness, enough to realize all the work I need to do.

## Being Less Wrong More Often

### What this means

I value having true beliefs. 

This may sound odd, but I believe it is important that my understanding of the
world is correct to the best of my ability. It presupposes the existence of
ground truth (because, lets be honest, we wouldn't look both ways at crosswalks
if we thought truth was completely subjective). If there is ground truth out
there, then why should we not try to shape our beliefs to be closest to
reality? 

### Radical Epistemic Humility

Being less wrong is about embracing being wrong as a stepping stone towards
being right. This approach is radically empirical. It means divorcing my ego
completely from my predictive beliefs. This is **very hard**. I fail at this
consistently. It means you have to seek out those ideas that radically
challenge yours, face them openly, and seriously entertain whether they are
true. Evaluating beliefs on their merit means potentially believing very
unsavory perspectives if they This is where my openness to experience is
stretched and tested.  fit the evidence better. It's painful and alienating for
the people around you.  But at the end of the day, the truth is worth holding.

## Shortcoming: Developing Discipline  

An amoral virtue I feel the need to cultivate is that of Discipline. So much of
the success, curiosity, and passion that drive me are fickle in their source.
They could not carry me through a winter. They are useful tools but are
capricious. Discipline, for me at least, is an undeveloped muscle. I often fail
to hold myself to deadlines, to do what I said I will do by the time I said I
would, and when the going gets tough to be tough enough to keep going.

If I could be more disciplined, I would be better able to manage my time and
accomplish the goals that matter to me when passion for them is no longer
enough to see it through.
