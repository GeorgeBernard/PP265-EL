# Life Mission

## Establishing the Ripple

I am not a spiritual person. It's not immediately clear to me what happens to
us when we die. If we are judged for our actions, how am I to live such that
Anubis measures my heart lighter than a feather? If we are not judged, then
what drives me to live the good life. If there is no judgment, then I should
pursue my own goals ruthlessly and selfishly. I am reminded of the words of Rabbi
Hillel the Elder

> If I am not for myself who is for me?  
> And being for my own self what am I?  
> If not now when?  

We tread a fine line with our time in this world, between acting in the service
of ourselves and acting in the service of others. My actions, if they are
ethical, should not be because of a fear of judgment or desire of heavenly
reward. My actions in the service of helping others and being true to myself
must be justified by a consistent goal. 

The key to all of this is in my **ripple**. The benefits I make on this world,
I hope, will last in the signal of kindness of others. There will come a day
when my name will be forgotten, everyone I know long dead, but the people I
help and the people they help and they help will continue. My benefit to the
world, my *raison de etre* is in the ripple of goodness that I will create to
my highest ability in my own sphere of influence.  

### Focus on Community

I live in the domain of the practical and the human. I want to be realistic
about the benefit I can make in the world. This does not mean I should
artifically limit the scope of my benefits, but that I focus on helping those
within my sphere of influence. 

One of my life goals is to have a deep connection with my tribe. I don't mean
this in a self secluding way. The connotation of focusing on your community can
come across as a dogwhistle for putting your own people first. When I say tribe
I mean a responsibility to my people across ethnic, class, religious, and
political lines. I want to seek out those who challenge me to be better and
think better. I want to make a place in my life for those people, and I want to
help them achieve their goals and to feel loved by their tribe in turn.

### Effective Altruism

Tempering this focus on the immediate community, we must see our ability to act
on the global scale. Our world is incredibly connected, and this has been
amazing for seeing the way that people around the world live. This has also
shown us the dire straits that many people in this world live in. We often lose
our will to act, to overcome the bystander effect, when we are so far away from
the problems that people face. Simply put, we cannot live in our progressive
western democracy, go to work in literal towering crystal spires, and
constantly think about "starving african children or whatever". 

There is huge cognitive dissonance here. If it meant getting our shoes dirty,
we would save a drowning child. If it meant getting on a plane and flying
across the world, we would still save a drowning child. From both of these toy
examples we see that the duty to act is always there, regardless of moderate
personal damage (ruining clothes) or distance (flying there). How do we get
from the high level ethical breakdown in which we are honorbound to act, to
what is implemented as fundamental apathy?

Don't get me wrong, I am not condemning the very human focus on the local over
the global, but one of my personal goals is to act efficiently in the service
of global issues. Ergo, my life mission adds two intertwined goals. First, I
want to donate large amounts of money to extremely effective charities
(malaria and schistosomiasis intiatives), and, second, I want to share this
approach to charity, that we should prioritize giving to extremely effective
charities and that we have a duty to act in what ways we can.

## Becoming a Craftsman

My last main goal is more amoral. I get pleasure out of making cool things. I
take pride in the things I make. I have that peculiar affliction that I am
good at, and deeply love, being an Engineer. It comes back to that Greek idea of Arete, I want to
maximize my potential in this direction. I want to be the best Engineer I can
be. Solving cool problems for smart people.

I am a toolmaker. I seek to build the tools that enable others to maximize
their potential. In this way, I also establish my ripple. I want to smash the
barriers that people have by enabling them to take advantage of humankinds
shared incredible computational power. A life of service as a humble toolmaker,
is a life I will not regret.
