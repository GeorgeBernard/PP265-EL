# Closing Comments and Reflections

I hope that after reading my leadership map, you have a better understanding of
the circumstances, decisions, and frameworks that have guided my life and made
me into the man I am today.

There are certainly things in this map I did not include for lack of my own
memory, space constraints, and (in some instances) issues too personal
for inclusion in a publicly available paper. If you notice one of these areas,
I welcome you to seek me out and drill down on this in private conversation, as
I would be happy to share one on one. 

This also applies if you find that you relate to my story and have some useful
advice on how you gained your moral courage. I need all the help I can get
here.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to learn a little about George.
He's a work in progress, but always with emphasis on the progress.
