# Executive Summary: One Page Leadership Map

## Life Values and Goals: A Life of Service to my Tribe 

- To my friends, family, and to the world large, finding my own
  fulfillment in helping them to chase theirs
- Be stronger hearted, more capable of fighting for what I believe in
- Make a ripple of generosity and helpfulness from the people I help

## Great Job = Challenge + Community

- Intellectually Challenging, to always be learning and applying new knowledge
  with like minded people
- Sense of camaraderie and unity of purpose, to have a fellowship and sense of
  community with my coworkers 
- Flexible in when and where I work, so long as I am sufficient in
  accomplishing my goals
- Sense of impact of work, that what I do either helps others or enables me to
  help others.

## What I'm good at

- Raw enthusiasm for learning and personal development (i.e. *joie de vivre*)
- Extroversion and genuine interest in the well-being of others.
- Large sense of responsibility for group settings
- Personal resilience to difficulty, enthusiasm in the face of discomfort
- Gregarious and loud, extremely willing to ask dumb question
- Reflectiveness and unbridled willingness to seek critical feedback and
  surround myself with those willing to challenge me and help me grow

## What I suck at

- Interpersonal soft skills (e.g. empathy, group dynamic awareness)
- Discipline to pursue goals that donâ€™t itch curiosity (i.e. not fun)
- Shadow side to my volume is that I can unintentionally rollover quieter folks
- Shadow side to my enthusiasm is that need a fuel that is less capricious
  when handling tasks that are not engaging
- I crave positive attention and often make group situations about me. I love
  the sound of my own voice, and need to de-center myself in group settings.
- I can often neglect my morals to fit in with the crowd or personal friends
  better

## How I will be better eventually

- Build moral habits, make doing the right thing instinctual vs. intentional
- Find and stick by those communities that most embody my values and challenge
  me to be more ethical
- Build the moral courage to act on my values outside of those communities and
  in the real world.

## How I will be better right now

- Poll my moral beacons and gurus on their advice on how to be better
- Sit with my own failures so that I may more deeply understand their source

## Big Questions

- How do I muster moral courage?
- How do I build discipline?
