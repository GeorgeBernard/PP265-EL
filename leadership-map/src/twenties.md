# Twenties Journey: Objective, Direction, and Path

It may seem paradoxical, but I am simultaneously sitting at a pivotal moment
and given a set of, in the long run, meaningless choices. The values I build
and cement in the first chunk of my adult life will stay with me as I move
forward. In the words of Joseph Campbell, as I join the adult world I switch
from a relationship of dependence to a relationship of independence, and
finally to a relationship of people depending on me. 

I am 23, I have spent my last 23 years in education system, with only a brief
foray into working as a coop student (6 months) and interning (2 months). I
have 8 months of reasonable adult experience. I sit at the precipice of a sea
change, a complete shift to self reliance where I no longer depend on my
parents income nor the communities built up by my schools and childhood
interests. This is a defining decade for the man I want to become.

Yet I can't help but remember Robert Frost's poem, "The Road Not Taken". The
poems protagonist comes to a fork in the road, and chooses a path. In what is
perhaps the most misunderstood poem in American popular thought, the meaning of
the poem is not that taking the road less traveled made all the difference, but
that the protagonist is rationalizing the future impact of what seems like a
weighty decision. The choices I make for my first job or city. Many choices
turn out to be irrelevant stumblings on my path.
