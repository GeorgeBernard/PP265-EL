# My Story

## Childhood: Setting The Stage

When I was born, my mom was scared to give me up. She was deeply worried that
the world would hurt me, that she needed to protect me. Her doula (a birth
assistant similar to a midwife) said to her, "No, he will protect you". 

These are the words that still echo in my life, the guiding perspective that I
should take care of my friends and neighbors, that I should live a life of
service to others.

### Family Traits

My personality, like most I assume, is deeply influenced by that of my family.
Both my parents drive me to develop my:

- Wit and Humor
- Charisma
- Generosity
- Worldliness

From my father, Collier, I most admire and try to emulate his:

- Nerdy love for math and science
- Diplomacy and desire to please others
- Enthusiasm

From my mother, Patti, I most admire and try to emulate her:

- Intense care for my family and friends
- Extraversion and a willingness to interact with everyone at their level
- Raw moral courage and strong heartedness
- Drive to succeed
- Candor

From my most older sister, Katy, I most admire and try to emulate her:

- Drive to succeed
- Intensity
- Steadfastness and commitment to her goals
- Kindness
- Intelligence (which is huge but she would never admit this to you)

From my less older sister, Alexi, I most admire and try to emulate her:

- Empathy
- Thoughtfulness
- Easygoing nature
- Creativity

These are but windows to the multi-faceted people they are, but I am deeply
grateful for the impact they have had and continue to have in my life. They are
my mentors, friends, and confidants. I would not be half the person I am today
without their influence.

### Primary School

In primary school, my parents placed me in an international school in Houston,
specifically the British School of Houston. There I came to learn and
incorporate the community values there. 

- Extreme Politeness
- Self Deprecating Humor
- Penchant for the absurd
- Family loyalty

These norms carried me through my childhood, with a special focus on humility.
I was (and still am to be clear) overweight and out of shape. This lack of
physical fitness could be seen in my chubbyness and my terrible performance in
physical education classes. I was consistently the last person in every test of
strength or endurance. This is not to say you should pity this child, as I only
bring it up to suggest how radically okay I was (or learned to be) with the
state of things. I had the worst times in any running event, being forced to
run and doing terribly in front of the entire school on sports day (an all
school competition day). I was by no means traumatized by this, it's more that
I learned firsthand I would not excel in all things. 

This is the essence of my humility. I will not be the best in all things. I
will not even be the best at any one thing. There are always people who are
better. The key is in understanding yourself as imperfect. Radically accepting
who you are, and striving to do better in what ways you can. It just took this
fat kid "running" a 100 m sprint in several minutes to learn it.

## Adolescence: Building Character in "The Woods"

At the age of 14, with both of my older sisters having started their college
journeys. My parents wanted to move us to Colorado to better help with their
quality of life, deeply improving my Dad's allergies. 

### Antifragility: Resilience built through Adversity

I was enrolled in *Colorado Rocky Mountain School*, and that August I started
in the Wilderness Orientation program. This was without a doubt the hardest
physical challenge of my life. For wilderness orientation, we are taken out in
groups of 7-9 incoming students and 2 faculty members and 1 student leader. The
first three days were spent doing trail maintenance. The last 7 were spent
backpacking in the remote colorado wilderness. 

Keep in mind, I was an out of shape fat kid from Houston Texas. I had never
been challenged physically like this at all. I could count on one hand the
hikes I had done before this. To this day, I am deeply ashamed of how the
leaders needed to ferry my pack so that I could simply make it up the hill
unweighted. On the last day of the trip, water had dripped through the tarp
(that I had poorly set up myself) onto my chest as I slept. I woke up cold and
broken. We were then promptly forced to get out of our sleeping bags, wake up
and tackle the new and final day of the trip. When I finally got out of my bag,
I was bawling. My group was visibly worried for me, crying as I laced up my
hiking boots. I balanced out again, and this same story played out a few more
times in my outdoor experiences. Later that semester, I was in a canoe with a
classmate failing miserably to ferry our boat across only the most moderate of
rolling river. I cried out that I was trying my hardest, and it wasn't good
enough. 

The thing is, after you are broken so many times by intensely difficult
experiences, you learn to handle it. You learn to roll with the punches. After
enough of roughing it in the woods, you learn to get rougher. Nasim
Nicholas-Taleb writes about the concept of **Antifragility**, when a system
performs better under stress. I feel like this is what controlled discomfort
did for me. I have felt at my best in a stressful moment on a backpacking trip.
I have felt clarity when I have to make our team not lost, administer aid for a
hypothermic trip member, or cook dinner for my crew so they can get in the tent
and warm up. There is a unique energy to these make or break moments. In a
modern world of absolute luxury (at least for those with my privilege) you
break out of the "first world problems" by leaning in to the uncomfortable and
difficult in the woods. These experiences calibrated what I view as truly
stressful, and made into a more emotionally stable person.

### Lessons from Antiquity: Lao Tze and "The Way"

Over the summer before my sophomore year, my dad handed me a translation of the
Tao Te Ching, a work of chinese poems that worked as a textual basis for the
Taoist tradition. The rough translation of the title is the "Book of the Way".

The primary themes are all about stepping back, listening to the world, and
acting along the path of least resistance. There are amazing sections which
still give me chills to this day. 

Excerpts like this from Stephen Mitchell's translation, 

> 8   
> The supreme good is like water,   
> which nourishes all things without trying to.   
> It is content with the low places that people disdain.   
> Thus it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground.   
> In thinking, keep to the simple.   
> In conflict, be fair and generous.   
> In governing, don't try to control.   
> In work, do what you enjoy.   
> In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself   
> and don't compare or compete,   
> everybody will respect you.   

and,

> 13   
> Success is as dangerous as failure.  
> Hope is as hollow as fear. What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?   
> Whether you go up the ladder or down it,   
> you position is shaky.   
> When you stand with your two feet on the ground,   
> you will always keep your balance. What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?   
> Hope and fear are both phantoms   
> that arise from thinking of the self.   
> When we don't see the self as self,   
> what do we have to fear? See the world as your self.   
> Have faith in the way things are.   
> Love the world as your self;   
> then you can care for all things.   

made me focus inward and critically examine my self.
You can feel the humility and presence in this. This book inspired me to be
more humble, to listen first to understand then to speak. To see my own path in
this period of change that is puberty. This narrative is fundamentally
different than the mainstream western ideals. Seek not success, or, better yet,
seek not, for you may find success as a side effect of living the good life. 

There may yet be faults in the gentle approach, but as a growing boy, with
culture that leans towards trying to be a **Big Man**, it was a deeply useful
moral reference text for me.

### Lessons from Antiquity: Ancient Greece

The liberal arts program at my school had a deep love for the classical period.
I've included some of the lessons from then that have most served as guiding
models for my behavior.

#### Arete: Fulfilling Your Potential

The pre-socratics had this beautiful idea of measuring virtue. They knew that
people were born in fundamentally different circumstances. They knew that an
enslaved serf could not rise to the same heights as a landed gentry. They
defined Arete as this proportion of your own potential that you achieve. If you
have less potential than someone with more privilege, but you actualize all of
your potential and they actualize half of theirs, you have cultivated more
virtue.

This was a great introduction to concepts of privilege and inequality in the
modern world. It allowed me (a white cis-het male) to avoid the pitfalls of
wondering why other people weren't doing as well as I did. It was much like Ben
Sands spoke at the 36 hours at Duke event. He said that he would much prefer
someone to work their way out of an impoverished slum and change the world,
but the barriers to that are so fundamentally high, that we do a disservice to
those people by not capitalizing on our own potential. 

I interpret this now as a call to action for those who won the birth lottery to
be placed in my socio-ethno-political class. If we do not actualize our
potential in the service of others, if we do not lower the barriers so that
others may actualize their potential than what good can we say we have done
with our own potential.

#### Socrates' Moral Imperative: When To Be The Biting Fly

We come to the trial and death of Socrates. In his defense, before the court of
Athens, he said that he himself was the biting fly on its rear end. That he was
spurring the people of Athens to be better, by asking the hard questions, by
being a deeply annoying person, by questioning and laying bare their
fundamental beliefs. He was so stubborn, that rather than apologize and pledge
to bother people less, he leaned in and took the death penalty, a glass of
hemlock.

Sometimes I feel like the biting fly, and sometimes I feel like the Horse's
buttock. I'm no Socrates. He alienated so many of his countrymen. To this day I
still wonder when to bite down on someone's idea and when to let it go. Lao Tze
got to me first, teaching me to be gentle and bend rather than steadfast and
bite. Yet sometimes I wish I had the moral courage of Socrates to so stand by
his principles as to throw his life on the line.  

### Lessons from Antiquity: Roman Stoicism

The hip new thing in Silicon Valley is Roman Stoicism. I don't want to pull a
bearded hipster and say "I liked it before it was cool", but I was lucky that
my high school education included reading and interpreting texts from that
period. Hopefully some of these anecdotes will elucidate how I learned my
behaviors.

#### Life Is Long If You Know How To Use It - Seneca

In his work, Seneca makes the connection that just in the way that money, when
spent wisely and frugally, lasts longer so too does the time in our days. We
must wisely and deliberately spend our time throughout our days so that we may
do the most with them. It seems obvious now, but to sophomore year George,
these words were gold. He wanted so much to improve, and so he learned to sieze
the day and do that which he would most benefit. 

This had a shadow side however. Living deliberately is not cost free. It takes
great effort to keep yourself accountable and taking advantage of every moment.
And when I made it to University this proved to be unsustainable. There were
simply too many things. I was splitting my time so widely that I lacked depth
in doing any one thing well. I needed to reign in and take a deeper look at
this lesson. Just in the same way that we only have so much influence, we
should focus on what our time is valued at, and fill it not only with the most
*productive* but the most *fulfilling* activities. Choose to spend your time
with friends knowing the impact of your choice. Live with presence, i.e.
awareness of the present, to maximize your time here on earth.

#### Wake and Do The Work of Man - Marcus Aurelius

My history teacher, Dave Meyer, would often read a passage from Marcus
Aurelius' "Meditations".

> I. In the morning when thou findest thyself unwilling to rise, consider with
> thyself presently, it is to go about a man's work that I am stirred up. Am I
> then yet unwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought
> forth into this world? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much
> of myself in a warm bed? 'O but this is pleasing.' And was it then for this
> that thou wert born, that thou mightest enjoy pleasure? 

We learn that even Marcus Aurelius, leader of the Roman empire, had trouble
getting out of bed every morning. Questioning his purpose and why he would
struggle to cast off his blanket. He contends that it is his nature to work,
and that failure to work in the morning is a failure to retain integrity (self
alignment with his own nature).  

Often when I am procrastinating an assignment, or hesitant to get out of bed,
the motivation I need to here is not that my day will be easy, but that it will
be truly difficult but I must complete it anyway. That day I woke up wet and
weary on my Wilderness Orientation, what got me out of bed was knowing that in
order to end the trip, I needed to get up and get going. 

### Lessons from Modernity: Positive Existentialism

Although both my parents believed in God and had been raised as Baptist and
Catholic respectively, I was not raised in a religious tradtion. I had never
had that proclivity for existential crises that many others struggle with when
faced with a lack of objective meaning in their lives. I knew that I would
die, but I have always been agnostic, unsure of what lays beyond, preferring to
act as ethically as I can and roll the cosmic dice. 

I was lucky that in my senior year, before I had really drilled down on any
existential dread, I was exposed to Eastern and Western philosophical
traditions in respective classes. These classes were offered within the same
semester, both taught by the same teacher, Mark Clark (who was also one heck of
a cross country skier). After a separate curriculum in the two classes for the
first two thirds of the semester, both classes funnel into the synthesis of
eastern and western thought into the modern eras existentialist literature. 

There was something so motivating, so empowering, about hearing how there was
no objective path, no objective meaning. It was up to me to decide for myself
my best way to live my life. These classes helped me to formulate my worldview
as a kind of deeply positive nihilism. Combined with the curriculum of Roman
stoicism, I became a deeply happy pessimist. Camus showed me the absurdity of
life, and I chose to laugh and get on with it. Sartre showed me the radical
freedom I had in my life. Simone de Beauvoire showed me how to be comfortable
and embrace the ambiguity at the heart of life. There's no fundamental bedrock
to base our morality on, but it didn't stop me from being moral, only called
upon me to make my own morals and act in the way I think is best. 

### Lessons from the Community: Friends That Promote You

Starting high school, I found the friends that were immediately available. This
section is not to make moral judgments about them. My two friends, names
changed, Tom and Jack, I had met on wilderness orientation. They were very fun
people and I loved spending time with them. I cared about them and they cared
about me, yet I feel like the dynamic left a lot to be desired. I often felt
like the funny whipping post. I felt like they often intentionally bothered me
to get a rise out of me. By sophomore and junior year, I had grown tired of
trying to rely on any deeper connection with them. Around sophomore year, I had
gotten to know my now best friend, Tanner. What was different about my
relationship with Tanner was how he promoted me. I felt like my goals were his
goals and that made his goals my goals. To this day we are deeply loyal to each
other. This experience, while not really dramatic, helped me isolate that I
should not be "lazy" in finding friends. That I should seek out and work to
surround myself with people that have my best interests in heart. Not to say I
cannot be friends with people like Tom and Jack, we still talk and have fun
together, but that I should not base my worth in their evaluations. I found a
confidant in Tanner, and to this day that relationship has been worth it's
weight in gold. 

### Lessons from the Community: Accountability To The Collective

My school was founded by three people, deeply influenced by quaker thought.
Every week we had all school meetings in an upcycled barn. These would break
down into:

1. Decisions
2. Apologies
3. Thank You's and Shout Out's
4. Announcments

The focus was on putting the community above yourself. That even if you failed
you can still be held accountable and helped back along the noble path by your
peers. 

Our school nurtured a community of interdependence. Our day broke down into
three categories: school, sport, and work. In sport, in our outdoor excursions,
we would need to rely on each other to belay us when climbing or throw a rope
and catch our kayak when we bail out of our boats in a rapid. In work, we all
pitched in to improve and maintain our school; I helped maintain the schools
fleet of activity buses, and my friends worked blowing our cafeterias glassware
or throwing the clay in our communal mugs; Some even worked in the kitchen
preparing our meals, or in the garden supplementing our diets with fresh
produce. It was, in no uncertain terms, quite the hippie-dippie commune. We
relied on each other at that school, and it set me on the path towards serving
my community.

## University: A Sobering Climb towards Maturity

Coming to Duke was so fundamentally different than high school, but at the same
time played to my strengths. I came to Duke, and was lucky enough to go on the
PWILD August Trip, a student led backpacking trip for incoming freshman. It was
like the synthesis of my CRMS experiences while being surrounded by deeply
thoughtful and intelligent people.

### Success At Duke

I hesitate to admit it in writing, but I am evaluated as "smart". What does
this mean? To me it means that I have a winning combination of radical
enthusiasm for learning, the ability to synthesize new ideas, and break down
problems into small easier to tackle problems. This has allowed me to attain
fairly substantial academic success at Duke without destroying myself. I still
spend many a Friday night in the library, but I enjoy it. 

When I got to Duke my freshman year, I found that I excelled in my classes
with, to me at least, moderate effort. I was incredibly lucky to find a domain,
computer engineering, that both interested me greatly and I in turn was good
at.  

### Failure in Success: Losing Humility

At Duke, I lost some of that humility I had spent my younger life
building. I let this academic success get to my head. I grew cocky and
quietly nurtured a superiority complex. For lack of better words, this was
stupid. 

After feedback from others (once again the importance of community call outs),
I realized what I had lost. I am only now on the path toward regaining some of
this honest self awareness of my place in the grand scheme of things.

### Moral Development

Let me say that I was, and still am, deeply problematic. I only have the words
to describe my own immaturity at this point of my life from the work I have
done and others have done alongside me that help contextualize this. On PWILD,
on the first night, I told a series of dirty jokes that were deeply
inappropriate and must have made my fellow crew deeply uncomfortable with me.
Thinking about it now, I feel deeply ashamed of myself for this. The trip went
on, and I was exposed to the struggles that my fellow crew had. On the tail
side of the trip, I had made a misogynist and objectifying comment about a
"Wild Women's Retreat" event we were passing by, and a staffer called me out
for it. I couldn't find the words to respond. They were right, and I was being
hurtful. I sat in silence and licked my wounds. This was the start of my change
for the better, but even getting better cannot erase the past. When I think
about how trash I was and what progress I have made it only motivates me to be
even more thoughtful, kind, and nuanced in my language.

### Being Criticized: The Importance of Community Call Outs

For me, this is the essence of why being called out is exactly what I needed to
spur me towards being a better person. Let's be honest, someone needed to set
me straight. I wish that I could have come to this realization myself, but I
lacked the tools. Someone else had to put in the emotional labor of confronting
me. These people I, to this day, deeply admire and thank for their work in
making me a better person.

It's true for so many men of my own age, and I was only lucky enough to be
paying attention at those moments of ripeness. The most progress and change I
have made morally come from those evenings where, following a call out earlier
that day, I was forced to entertain the idea of my misgivings. I was only lucky
enough to be open to alternatives. The combination of my own humility, with the
(far more important) call to be better by those I admired in my community
helped me to that sobering climb towards maturity. 

### Duke Men's Project

In my junior year at Duke, I joined the Duke Men's Project, a brand new (at the
time) intiative to make a community of men who would help teach each other to
be more moral and aware people. We met weekly at the women's center on east
campus to discuss issues underpinning systemic inequality and
intersectionality. It was a tremendously useful learning experience for me.

At this point I have to take a quick aside to talk about my issues with the
word "woke". When we call someone woke, I feel that we are turning awareness
into moral points. By splitting the world into people who are woke or not, we
make two mistakes: people who are woke are sufficiently good and do not need to
continue learning, and people who are not woke know less about hardship and
struggle than those who are. To say that we are woke is to lose the fact that
we are all crooked timber, stumbling towards being better. It's like a
commoditized moral license. Once you are woke, then you can sit back and
relax. Awarness is useless without action. Guilt is useless if it does not spur
you to change the structures that you feel guilty about. Just because we are
good in one area, gives us zero free passes in other areas.  

I bring this up because I feel that, even as we tried for this not to happen,
the Men's project encouraged allyship as an identity. That now that we've done
the Men's project, we were woke and everything was amazing. The Men's project
gave me the words and perspective to only start the path towards being a better
person. It was the first step on a never ending personal journey towards being
better and acting better, by helping those people who are most hurt by these
power structures, and leveraging our privilege to tackle them. 

I am not woke, I am deeply problematic on a daily basis. It's not okay. Every
day I try to be better, and every day I stumble.

That has been my moral development, embracing that I am crooked timber, and
embracing the struggle to not only have more moral beliefs, but more moral
actions as well.
