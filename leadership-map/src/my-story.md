# My Story

## Childhood: Setting The Stage

When I was born, my mom was scared to give me up. She was deeply worried that
the world would hurt me, that she needed to protect me. Her doula (a birth
assistant similar to a midwife) said to her, "No, he will protect you". 

These are the words that still echo in my life, the guiding perspective that I
should take care of my friends and neighbors, that I should live a life of
service to others.

### Establishing Norms

In primary school, my parents placed me in an international school in Houston,
specifically the British School of Houston. There I came to learn and
incorporate the community values there. 

- Extreme Politeness
- Self Deprecating Humor
- Penchant for the absurd
- Family loyalty

These norms carried me through my childhood, with a special focus on humility.
I was (and still am to be clear) overweight and out of shape. This lack of
physical fitness could be seen in my chubbyness and my terrible performance in
physical education classes. I was consistently the last person in every test of
strength or endurance. This is not to say you should pity this child, as I only
bring it up to suggest how radically okay I was (or learned to be) with the
state of things. I had the worst times in any running event, being forced to
run and doing terribly in front of the entire school on sports day (an all
school competition day). I was by no means traumatized by this, it's more that
I learned firsthand I would not excel in all things. 

This is the essence of my humility. I will not be the best in all things. I
will not even be the best at any one thing. There are always people who are
better. The key is in understanding yourself as imperfect. Radically accepting
who you are, and striving to do better in what ways you can. It just took this
fat kid "running" a 100 m sprint in several minutes to learn it.

## Adolescence: Building Character in "The Woods"

At the age of 14, with both of my older sisters having started their college
journeys. My parents wanted to move us to Colorado to better help with their
quality of life, deeply improving my Dad's allergies. 

### Antifragility: Resilience built through Adversity

I was enrolled in *Colorado Rocky Mountain School*, and that August I started
in the Wilderness Orientation program. This was without a doubt the hardest
physical challenge of my life. For wilderness orientation, we are taken out in
groups of 7-9 incoming students and 2 faculty members and 1 student leader. The
first three days were spent doing trail maintenance. The last 7 were spent
backpacking in the remote colorado wilderness. 

Keep in mind, I was an out of shape fat kid from Houston Texas. I had never
been challenged physically like this at all. I could count on one hand the
hikes I had done before this. To this day, I am deeply ashamed of how the
leaders needed to ferry my pack so that I could simply make it up the hill
unweighted. On the last day of the trip, water had dripped through the tarp
(that I had poorly set up myself) onto my chest as I slept. I woke up cold and
broken. We were then promptly forced to get out of our sleeping bags, wake up
and tackle the new and final day of the trip. When I finally got out of my bag,
I was bawling. My group was visibly worried for me, crying as I laced up my
hiking boots. I balanced out again, and this same story played out a few more
times in my outdoor experiences. Later that semester, I was in a canoe with a
classmate failing miserably to ferry our boat across only the most moderate of
rolling river. I cried out that I was trying my hardest, and it wasn't good
enough. 

The thing is, after you are broken so many times by intensely difficult
experiences, you learn to handle it. You learn to roll with the punches. After
enough of roughing it in the woods, you learn to get rougher. Nasim
Nicholas-Taleb writes about the concept of **Antifragility**, when a system
performs better under stress. I feel like this is what controlled discomfort
did for me. I have felt at my best in a stressful moment on a backpacking trip.
I have felt clarity when I have to make our team not lost, administer aid for a
hypothermic trip member, or cook dinner for my crew so they can get in the tent
and warm up. There is a unique energy to these make or break moments. In a
modern world of absolute luxury (at least for those with my privilege) you
break out of the "first world problems" by leaning in to the uncomfortable and
difficult in the woods. These experiences calibrated what I view as truly
stressful, and made into a more emotionally stable person.

### Lessons from Antiquity: Lao Tze and "The Way"

Over the summer before my sophomore year, my dad handed me a translation of the
Tao Te Ching, a work of chinese poems that worked as a textual basis for the
Taoist tradition. The rough translation of the title is the "Book of the Way".

The primary themes are all about stepping back, listening to the world, and
acting along the path of least resistance. There are amazing sections which
still give me chills to this day. 

Excerpts like this from Stephen Mitchell's translation,

> The supreme good is like water,

> In conflict, be fair and generous.

made me focus inward and critically examine my self.
You can feel the humility and presence in this. This book inspired me to be
more humble, to listen first to understand then to speak. To see my own path in
this period of change that is puberty. This narrative is fundamentally
different than the mainstream western ideals. Seek not success, or, better yet,
seek not, for you may find success as a side effect of living the good life. 

There may yet be faults in the gentle approach, but as a growing boy, with
culture that leans towards trying to be a **Big Man**, it was a deeply useful
moral reference text for me.

### Lessons from Antiquity: Ancient Greece

The liberal arts program at my school had a deep love for the classical period.
I've included some of the lessons from then that have most served as guiding
models for my behavior.

#### Arete: Fulfilling Your Potential

The pre-socratics had this beautiful idea of measuring virtue. They knew that
people were born in fundamentally different circumstances. They knew that an
enslaved serf could not rise to the same heights as a landed gentry. They
defined Arete as this proportion of your own potential that you achieve. If you
have less potential than someone with more privilege, but you actualize all of
your potential and they actualize half of theirs, you have cultivated more
virtue.

This was a great introduction to concepts of privilege and inequality in the
modern world. It allowed me (a white cis-het male) to avoid the pitfalls of
wondering why other people weren't doing as well as I did. It was much like Ben
Sands spoke at the 36 hours at Duke event. He said that he would much prefer
someone to work their way out of an impoverished slum and change the world,
but the barriers to that are so fundamentally high, that we do a disservice to
those people by not capitalizing on our own potential. 

I interpret this now as a call to action for those who won the birth lottery to
be placed in my socio-ethno-political class. If we do not actualize our
potential in the service of others, if we do not lower the barriers so that
others may actualize their potential than what good can we say we have done
with our own potential.

#### Socrates' Moral Imperative: When To Be The Biting Fly

We come to the trial and death of Socrates. In his defense, before the court of
Athens, he said that he himself was the biting fly on its rear end. That he was
spurring the people of Athens to be better, by asking the hard questions, by
being a deeply annoying person, by questioning and laying bare their
fundamental beliefs. He was so stubborn, that rather than apologize and pledge
to bother people less, he leaned in and took the death penalty, a glass of
hemlock.

Sometimes I feel like the biting fly, and sometimes I feel like the Horse's
buttock. I'm no Socrates. He alienated so many of his countrymen. To this day I
still wonder when to bite down on someone's idea and when to let it go. Lao Tze
got to me first, teaching me to be gentle and bend rather than steadfast and
bite. Yet sometimes I wish I had the moral courage of Socrates to so stand by
his principles as to throw his life on the line.  

### Lessons from Antiquity: Roman Stoicism

The hip new thing in Silicon Valley is Roman Stoicism. I don't want to pull a
bearded hipster and say "I liked it before it was cool", but I was lucky that
my high school education included reading and interpreting texts from that
period. Hopefully some of these anecdotes will elucidate how I learned my
behaviors.

#### Life Is Long If You Know How To Use It - Seneca

In his work, Seneca makes the connection that just in the way that money, when
spent wisely and frugally, lasts longer so too does the time in our days. We
must wisely and deliberately spend our time throughout our days so that we may
do the most with them. It seems obvious now, but to sophomore year George,
these words were gold. He wanted so much to improve, and so he learned to sieze
the day and do that which he would most benefit. 

This had a shadow side however. Living deliberately is not cost free. It takes
great effort to keep yourself accountable and taking advantage of every moment.
And when I made it to University this proved to be unsustainable. There were
simply too many things. I was splitting my time so widely that I lacked depth
in doing any one thing well. I needed to reign in and take a deeper look at
this lesson. Just in the same way that we only have so much influence, we
should focus on what our time is valued at, and fill it not only with the most
*productive* but the most *fulfilling* activities. Choose to spend your time
with friends knowing the impact of your choice. Live with presence, i.e.
awareness of the present, to maximize your time here on earth.

#### Wake and Do The Work of Man - Marcus Aurelius

My history teacher, Dave Meyer, would often read a passage from Marcus
Aurelius' "Meditations".

> I. In the morning when thou findest thyself unwilling to rise, consider with
> thyself presently, it is to go about a man's work that I am stirred up. Am I
> then yet unwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought
> forth into this world? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much
> of myself in a warm bed? 'O but this is pleasing.' And was it then for this
> that thou wert born, that thou mightest enjoy pleasure? 

We learn that even Marcus Aurelius, leader of the Roman empire, had trouble
getting out of bed every morning. Questioning his purpose and why he would
struggle to cast off his blanket. He contends that it is his nature to work,
and that failure to work in the morning is a failure to retain integrity (self
alignment with his own nature).  

Often when I am procrastinating an assignment, or hesitant to get out of bed,
the motivation I need to here is not that my day will be easy, but that it will
be truly difficult but I must complete it anyway. That day I woke up wet and
weary on my Wilderness Orientation, what got me out of bed was knowing that in
order to end the trip, I needed to get up and get going.
