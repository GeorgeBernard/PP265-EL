## Primer on Integrity

For this section, it is useful to understand what I mean when I say integrity.
I mean it as the sweet spot where our actions overlap with our intentions.

The closer our behavioral values represent our intended values, the more
integrity we produce for ourselves.

## My Moral Beacons and Role Models

I have always learned to be a better person by the quality of my company. Those
I most admire are those I most stand to learn from. There is something about
everyone that I can admire and want to copy and assimilate into my being. I
have simply too many role models to list, but I can attempt to list the
categories of those people whom I admire.

- Immense, Raw Empathy
- Absolute Kindness
- Humility
- Generosity
- Strong-Heartedness and the Moral Courage to Act

Those same categories I list for my role models, are those traits that are the
largest delta growth opportunities for myself. As I said before, I have learned
the most and am immeasurably grateful to those people who had the courage to
"set me straight". I often feel that I behave in cocky, cold, and lukewarm way.
All of my role models have rock solid integrity; they act in the way they
believe they should and have the "Heart of a Lion" that drives them to be true
to themselves.

## My Moral System: How I want to act

### Touchstone Principles

These represent the set of moral guidelines I have absorbed via osmosis from my
communities. While touching on some of these in my personal story, I'll try to
synthesize 

#### Royal Law

The biblical passage:

> Love thy neighbor as thyself

is a fundamental moral tenet of western society, and it harkens back to the
words of Rabbi Hillel the Elder or the line from poem #8 from the Tao Te Ching:

> Love the world as your self; then you can care for all things.

This is a manner of living where you value others success just as much as your
own success. That you would take care of your neighbor in the same way you
would expect to be taken care of.

#### Expedition Behavior

On many of my trips with CRMS, our staffers often read the rules of
expeditionary behavior. The most common, and most humorous, list is by Howard
Tomb, summarized below. 

> 1. Get the hell out of bed.
> 2. Do not be cheerful before breakfast
> 3. Do not complain
> 4. Learn to cook at least one thing right
> 5. Either A) Shampoo, or B) Do not remove your hat for any reason
> 6. Do not ask if anybody's seen your stuff
> 7. Never ask where you are
> 8. Always carry more than your fair share
> 9. Do not get sunburned
> 10. Do not get killed

These are very glib, but they get at heart of what expedetionary behavior
means. It is a focus on putting the group above yourself. If you want to
survive an expedition you need to rely on your team. 

We were read this on my first outdoor excursion, Wilderness Orientation. On
that trip I felt deeply ashamed that I was holding the group back. I swore
moving forward that I would never weigh down the group. It meant being cheerful
when the cards were down, and stepping up to do more for the group when the
call was made.

#### Utilitarianism: Minimize Harm

For me, utilitarian ethics are the safety net of determining the moral thing to
do. By assigning numerical value (a crude approximation at best) to different
outcomes it allows us to gauge a moral crisis decision point in an "objective"
way. 

At the end of the day, when none of my values can give me the clarity I need to
make a decision, I rely on the brutal calculus of maximizing social good, and
minimizng social pain.

### Moral Compass

Taking all of my touchstones into account, this section asks me to define what
I value, to solve that hardest problem of how to prioritize my moral values and
make me realize just what I will never give up.

#### Ethical Value Ranking: Intention vs. Implementation

When I look at how I rank Josephson's core values, I get the following:

1. Justice and Fairness
2. Caring
3. Responsibility
4. Respect
5. Trustworthiness
6. Civic Virtue and Citizenship

But when I meditate on my behavior I realize that I often rank "Justice and
Fairness" below Respect, and shift everything up. This is representative of my
most fundamental area for growth: Moral Courage. 

After taking Ben Sands values finder, I get the following for my "Most
Important Values:

1. Concern for Others
2. Humility
3. Belonging
4. Prosperity
5. Responsibility

and for my "Top Values by Behavior":

1. Humility
2. Belonging
3. Concern for Others
4. Loyalty
5. Achievement

Scratching off Achivement as an amoral value, I get that the way I act is
deeply focused on others. 

I have in my head this set of consistent guidelines for ethical behavior, yet
in my actions I often let things slide. I stumble consistently off my moral
path. I find that I often have so much care for others, so much loyalty, so
much need for belonging that I don't stand up for my beliefs when I hear the
call. I have too deep a need for approval by the group for me to act
consistently on the standards I have set for myself. 

### Moral Code: Specifics

Distilling my moral compass into habits, strategies, and behaviors, I get my
moral code. The day to day tactical decisions I make in order to act according
to my values.

#### Duty to Act

First, I have a duty to act when I see no one else acting. I abhor being a
bystander. Even if it is awkward and even if it proves unnecessary I should, on
habit and instinct alone, lend a helping hand. 

When it came to the parable of the Sadhu, I felt like I had a moral obligation
to help him down the mountain. Even if it cost me my trip. I might have been
upset to break my plan, but it doesn't matter. On the day to day basis, I feel
a direct obligation, a moral duty, to help those who are in need.

I don't assume this of everyone, and it is a lot to assume of myself. Many
other people around me may be struggling with their own issues and be unable to
help. This is not a categorical imperative for the world to follow, this is a
principle in which only I hold myself accountable to. The benchmark is only for
myself.

**If I see someone suffering under injustice or difficulty, and I do not help
(thinking someone else will), I am complicit in that suffering**

#### Do not be a burden

This follows from my first point. The people around me, and I've learned this
from experience, are dealing with issues so much more intense, traumatic, and
fundamental than mine. When I am upset with my life, or just feeling in a funk,
I think carefully of who I want to share this with. If I can deal with it
alone, then all the better. 

I am not saying that I shouldn't share, only that I want to follow that spirit
of expedition behavior. Unless it is absolutely necessary, don't complain. In
the terminology of wilderness first aid, "Don't create another patient".

**Do not be a burden on others. It is healthy to share and connect, but do not
overrely on the emotional and physical labor of others**

#### Be kind

This goes without saying. It takes so little of me, and helps others so much,
to be a warm face, a deep hugger, and an attentive listener. 

**Be nice.**

### Moral Code: Exceptions

I do find exceptions to this code, however. Moral action is a melange of
intention and implementation. While my moral code has focused so far on the
happy path, it must be tempered by exceptions.

#### Minimize Harm

If what may seem like moral behavior along my code is actually doing harm, then
I should not do it.

If I am harming myself too deeply by not sharing my struggle, if I am too quick
to "help" without understanding the nuance of a situation, or if my attempts to
be "nice" to someone bolsters their confidence to perform hurtful actions, then
my actions are not helping.

Thus the heuristics of my moral code must be balanced by the consequentialism
of my utilitarian ethos. 

#### Respect Autonomy

The other exception is actually a subset of my goal of minimizing harm, but
relates to a more fundamental respect for the autonomy of others. 

Just as someone of sane mind has the right to refuse emergency medical
services, so too do they have the right to reject my assistance. When my
"helping" is felt as smothering and patronizing, I know I have gone too far.  

## My Character: How I actually act

My character is built from fundamental traits and principles. Many of these are
strengths, and many of my strengths have shadow sides from their logical
terminus. Here I try to list those that are indeed fundamental to my core
character, those principles I live and die by. This is where the rubber meets
the road, and all those fancy principles face the reality of my actions and the
weakness of my humanity.

### Where I am most proud

First we start with the good news, where the overlap of intention and
implementation have seen the most integrity. These are the results of my moral
behavior that I am most proud of, the best habits and results I have made from
acting as I should.

I despise to self-aggrandize so these will be curt, bulleted lists.

#### Generosity

I am most proud of my generosity in time, emotional labor, and money. If I am
called upon by anyone in need

- Taken many hours to help those struggling with class assignments
- Brought food and gifts to sick friends
- Always made time for others when they need to confide in me
- Consistently pick up hitchhikers
- Consistently give money or food to panhandlers
    - And if I am unable always treat with respect and humanity
- Consistently donated to effective causes (GiveDirectly and Malaria
  Initiatives)

#### Warmth

Next, I am deeply proud of my warmth and kindness. I feel that I am loved by my
peers for my smile, hearty laugh, and joy. I'm deeply happy to be a source of
warmth and affirmation for my friends, family, and countrymen.

### Where I fail to measure up

But now we must cover the bad news, where the implementation lost track of my
intention. Where I lack the most integrity. These are where I stumbled most,
the worst parts of my moral behavior, and where I am still deeply ashamed of.

#### Moral Courage and Honesty

I consistently feel uncomfortable standing up for my values in many of my
personal relationships. I consistently fail to be honest when it comes to
disappointing someone I care about. In many social groups, I find myself being
a value chameleon, camoflaging myself to fit in with the dominant ideology. It
is so fundamentally hard to rip the band-aid, get it off your chest. 

I am king of the white lie. This is the shadow of not wanting to be a burden.
When I know that knowledge of something will hurt someone, I will lie, and it
kills me. It kills me to betray their trust. It kills me to laugh off hurtful
language said by a high school friend. It kills me to maintain a facade,
yet I once again lack the moral courage to hurt them. Tony said it beautifully
in class:

> If what you need to do will hurt someone, you should expect to feel some pain
> yourself...

Part of what prevents me from coming clean in these situations, is that value
of loyalty and belonging, my pathological need for approval. I perceive the
damage that will happen to a relationship and rather than choosing the path of
strength, that preserves my integrity and centers me on my values, I choose the
path of weakness, that fractures my core and breeds shame.

This is so fundamental a problem, and I don't know how to get better at it. I
only feel the damage I do to myself when I act in this way.

The only strategy I know of is to build my moral courage like a muscle. To
start it off slowly with minor skirmishes and confrontations, test it and
strecth it, until it can hold its own in the wild. I so deeply want to be a
stronger person, to have that "heart of a lion" that I admire so much in
others. I am agape to how they built that strength.

Even if I am so ready to help others, so eager to break the barriers in front
of other's success, how can I help them when I am incapable of speaking truth
to power, of being the shield to others who were given so much less than me.

I only know those barriers on the way to moral courage. I know that while I
still seek out the approval of others with such fervor that I will never reach
that point. I know that while I place the health of a relationship unilaterally
above my moral fiber I will never reach that point. I know that while I
maintain a lie, even superfically, so that someone's feelings will not be hurth
I will never reach that point.

**When I die, do I want my eulogy to say "He was a nice guy, loved by all" or do
I want them to say "He acted with integrity, resolute and steadfast for what he
knew was right"?**
