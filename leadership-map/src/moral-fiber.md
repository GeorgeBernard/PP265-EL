## Primer on Integrity

For this section, it is useful to understand what I mean when I say integrity.
I mean it as the sweet spot where our actions overlap with our intentions.

## Moral Role Models

I have always learned to be a better person by the quality of my company. Those
I most admire are those I most stand to learn from. There is something about
everyone that I can admire and want to copy and assimilate into my being. I
have simply too many role models to list, but I can attempt to list the
categories of those people whom I admire.

- Immense, Raw Empathy
- Absolute Kindness
- Humility
- Generosity
- Strong-Heartedness and the Moral Courage to Act

Those same categories I list for my role models, are those traits that are the
largest delta growth opportunities for myself. I often feel that I behave in
cocky, cold, and lukewarm way. All of my role models have rock solid
integrity; they act in the way they believe they should and have the "Heart of
a Lion" that drives them to be true to themselves.

## My Character

My character is built from fundamental traits and principles. Many of these are
strengths, and many of my strengths have shadow sides from their logical
terminus. Here I try to list those that are indeed fundamental to my core
character, those principles I live and die by.
