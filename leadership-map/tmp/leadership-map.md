# Executive Summary: One Page Leadership Map
# Introduction
# My Story

## Childhood: Setting The Stage

When I was born, my mom was scared to give me up. She was deeply worried that
the world would hurt me, that she needed to protect me. Her doula (a birth
assistant similar to a midwife) said to her, "No, he will protect you". 

These are the words that still echo in my life, the guiding perspective that I
should take care of my friends and neighbors, that I should live a life of
service to others.

### Establishing Norms

In primary school, my parents placed me in an international school in Houston,
specifically the British School of Houston. There I came to learn and
incorporate the community values there. 

- Extreme Politeness
- Self Deprecating Humor
- Penchant for the absurd
- Family loyalty

These norms carried me through my childhood, with a special focus on humility.
I was (and still am to be clear) overweight and out of shape. This lack of
physical fitness could be seen in my chubbyness and my terrible performance in
physical education classes. I was consistently the last person in every test of
strength or endurance. This is not to say you should pity this child, as I only
bring it up to suggest how radically okay I was (or learned to be) with the
state of things. I had the worst times in any running event, being forced to
run and doing terribly in front of the entire school on sports day (an all
school competition day). I was by no means traumatized by this, it's more that
I learned firsthand I would not excel in all things. 

This is the essence of my humility. I will not be the best in all things. I
will not even be the best at any one thing. There are always people who are
better. The key is in understanding yourself as imperfect. Radically accepting
who you are, and striving to do better in what ways you can. It just took this
fat kid "running" a 100 m sprint in several minutes to learn it.

## Adolescence: Building Character in "The Woods"

At the age of 14, with both of my older sisters having started their college
journeys. My parents wanted to move us to Colorado to better help with their
quality of life, deeply improving my Dad's allergies. 

### Antifragility: Resilience built through Adversity

I was enrolled in *Colorado Rocky Mountain School*, and that August I started
in the Wilderness Orientation program. This was without a doubt the hardest
physical challenge of my life. For wilderness orientation, we are taken out in
groups of 7-9 incoming students and 2 faculty members and 1 student leader. The
first three days were spent doing trail maintenance. The last 7 were spent
backpacking in the remote colorado wilderness. 

Keep in mind, I was an out of shape fat kid from Houston Texas. I had never
been challenged physically like this at all. I could count on one hand the
hikes I had done before this. To this day, I am deeply ashamed of how the
leaders needed to ferry my pack so that I could simply make it up the hill
unweighted. On the last day of the trip, water had dripped through the tarp
(that I had poorly set up myself) onto my chest as I slept. I woke up cold and
broken. We were then promptly forced to get out of our sleeping bags, wake up
and tackle the new and final day of the trip. When I finally got out of my bag,
I was bawling. My group was visibly worried for me, crying as I laced up my
hiking boots. I balanced out again, and this same story played out a few more
times in my outdoor experiences. Later that semester, I was in a canoe with a
classmate failing miserably to ferry our boat across only the most moderate of
rolling river. I cried out that I was trying my hardest, and it wasn't good
enough. 

The thing is, after you are broken so many times by intensely difficult
experiences, you learn to handle it. You learn to roll with the punches. After
enough of roughing it in the woods, you learn to get rougher. Nasim
Nicholas-Taleb writes about the concept of **Antifragility**, when a system
performs better under stress. I feel like this is what controlled discomfort
did for me. I have felt at my best in a stressful moment on a backpacking trip.
I have felt clarity when I have to make our team not lost, administer aid for a
hypothermic trip member, or cook dinner for my crew so they can get in the tent
and warm up. There is a unique energy to these make or break moments. In a
modern world of absolute luxury (at least for those with my privilege) you
break out of the "first world problems" by leaning in to the uncomfortable and
difficult in the woods. These experiences calibrated what I view as truly
stressful, and made into a more emotionally stable person.

### Lessons from Antiquity: Lao Tze and "The Way"

Over the summer before my sophomore year, my dad handed me a translation of the
Tao Te Ching, a work of chinese poems that worked as a textual basis for the
Taoist tradition. The rough translation of the title is the "Book of the Way".

The primary themes are all about stepping back, listening to the world, and
acting along the path of least resistance. There are amazing sections which
still give me chills to this day. 

Excerpts like this from Stephen Mitchell's translation, 

> 8 
>
> The supreme good is like water, 
>
> which nourishes all things without trying to. 
>
> It is content with the low places that people disdain. 
>
> Thus it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground. 
>
> In thinking, keep to the simple. 
>
> In conflict, be fair and generous. 
>
> In governing, don't try to control. 
>
> In work, do what you enjoy. 
>
> In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself 
>
> and don't compare or compete, 
>
> everybody will respect you. 

and,

> Have faith in the way things are. 
>
> Love the world as your self; 
>
> then you can care for all things. 

made me focus inward and critically examine my self.
You can feel the humility and presence in this. This book inspired me to be
more humble, to listen first to understand then to speak. To see my own path in
this period of change that is puberty. This narrative is fundamentally
different than the mainstream western ideals. Seek not success, or, better yet,
seek not, for you may find success as a side effect of living the good life. 

There may yet be faults in the gentle approach, but as a growing boy, with
culture that leans towards trying to be a **Big Man**, it was a deeply useful
moral reference text for me.

### Lessons from Antiquity: Ancient Greece

The liberal arts program at my school had a deep love for the classical period.
I've included some of the lessons from then that have most served as guiding
models for my behavior.

#### Arete: Fulfilling Your Potential

The pre-socratics had this beautiful idea of measuring virtue. They knew that
people were born in fundamentally different circumstances. They knew that an
enslaved serf could not rise to the same heights as a landed gentry. They
defined Arete as this proportion of your own potential that you achieve. If you
have less potential than someone with more privilege, but you actualize all of
your potential and they actualize half of theirs, you have cultivated more
virtue.

This was a great introduction to concepts of privilege and inequality in the
modern world. It allowed me (a white cis-het male) to avoid the pitfalls of
wondering why other people weren't doing as well as I did. It was much like Ben
Sands spoke at the 36 hours at Duke event. He said that he would much prefer
someone to work their way out of an impoverished slum and change the world,
but the barriers to that are so fundamentally high, that we do a disservice to
those people by not capitalizing on our own potential. 

I interpret this now as a call to action for those who won the birth lottery to
be placed in my socio-ethno-political class. If we do not actualize our
potential in the service of others, if we do not lower the barriers so that
others may actualize their potential than what good can we say we have done
with our own potential.

#### Socrates' Moral Imperative: When To Be The Biting Fly

We come to the trial and death of Socrates. In his defense, before the court of
Athens, he said that he himself was the biting fly on its rear end. That he was
spurring the people of Athens to be better, by asking the hard questions, by
being a deeply annoying person, by questioning and laying bare their
fundamental beliefs. He was so stubborn, that rather than apologize and pledge
to bother people less, he leaned in and took the death penalty, a glass of
hemlock.

Sometimes I feel like the biting fly, and sometimes I feel like the Horse's
buttock. I'm no Socrates. He alienated so many of his countrymen. To this day I
still wonder when to bite down on someone's idea and when to let it go. Lao Tze
got to me first, teaching me to be gentle and bend rather than steadfast and
bite. Yet sometimes I wish I had the moral courage of Socrates to so stand by
his principles as to throw his life on the line.  

### Lessons from Antiquity: Roman Stoicism

The hip new thing in Silicon Valley is Roman Stoicism. I don't want to pull a
bearded hipster and say "I liked it before it was cool", but I was lucky that
my high school education included reading and interpreting texts from that
period. Hopefully some of these anecdotes will elucidate how I learned my
behaviors.

#### Life Is Long If You Know How To Use It - Seneca

In his work, Seneca makes the connection that just in the way that money, when
spent wisely and frugally, lasts longer so too does the time in our days. We
must wisely and deliberately spend our time throughout our days so that we may
do the most with them. It seems obvious now, but to sophomore year George,
these words were gold. He wanted so much to improve, and so he learned to sieze
the day and do that which he would most benefit. 

This had a shadow side however. Living deliberately is not cost free. It takes
great effort to keep yourself accountable and taking advantage of every moment.
And when I made it to University this proved to be unsustainable. There were
simply too many things. I was splitting my time so widely that I lacked depth
in doing any one thing well. I needed to reign in and take a deeper look at
this lesson. Just in the same way that we only have so much influence, we
should focus on what our time is valued at, and fill it not only with the most
*productive* but the most *fulfilling* activities. Choose to spend your time
with friends knowing the impact of your choice. Live with presence, i.e.
awareness of the present, to maximize your time here on earth.

#### Wake and Do The Work of Man - Marcus Aurelius

My history teacher, Dave Meyer, would often read a passage from Marcus
Aurelius' "Meditations".

> I. In the morning when thou findest thyself unwilling to rise, consider with
> thyself presently, it is to go about a man's work that I am stirred up. Am I
> then yet unwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought
> forth into this world? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much
> of myself in a warm bed? 'O but this is pleasing.' And was it then for this
> that thou wert born, that thou mightest enjoy pleasure? 

We learn that even Marcus Aurelius, leader of the Roman empire, had trouble
getting out of bed every morning. Questioning his purpose and why he would
struggle to cast off his blanket. He contends that it is his nature to work,
and that failure to work in the morning is a failure to retain integrity (self
alignment with his own nature).  

Often when I am procrastinating an assignment, or hesitant to get out of bed,
the motivation I need to here is not that my day will be easy, but that it will
be truly difficult but I must complete it anyway. That day I woke up wet and
weary on my Wilderness Orientation, what got me out of bed was knowing that in
order to end the trip, I needed to get up and get going.

# Life Mission

## Establishing the Ripple

I am not a spiritual person. It's not immediately clear to me what happens to
us when we die. If we are judged for our actions, how am I to live such that
Anubis measures my heart lighter than a feather? If we are not judged, then
what drives me to live the good life. If there is no judgment, then I should
pursue my own goals ruthlessly and selfishly. I am reminded of the words of Rabbi
Hillel the Elder

> If I am not for myself who is for me? And being for my own self what am I?
> If not now when?

We tread a fine line with our time in this world, between acting in the service
of ourselves and acting in the service of others. My actions, if they are
ethical, should not be because of a fear of judgment or desire of heavenly
reward. My actions in the service of helping others and being true to myself
must be justified by a consistent goal. 

The key to all of this is in my **ripple**. The benefits I make on this world, I
hope, will last in the signal of kindness of others. There will come a day when
my name will be forgotten, everyone I know long dead, but the people I help and
the people they help and they help will continue. My benefit to the world, my
*raison de etre* is in the ripple of goodness that I will create to my highest
ability in my own sphere of influence.  

### Focus on Community

I live in the domain of the practical and the human. I want to be realistic
about the benefit I can make in the world. This does not mean I should
artifically limit the scope of my benefits, but that I focus on helping those
within my sphere of influence. 

One of my life goals is to have a deep connection with my tribe. I don't mean
this in a self secluding way. The connotation of focusing on your community can
come across as a dogwhistle for putting your own people first. When I say tribe
I mean a responsibility to my people across ethnic, class, religious, and
political lines. I want to seek out those who challenge me to be better and
think better. I want to make a place in my life for those people, and I want to
help them achieve their goals and to feel loved by their tribe in turn.

### Effective Altruism

Tempering this focus on the immediate community, we must see our ability to act
on the global scale. Our world is incredibly connected, and this has been
amazing for seeing the way that people around the world live. This has also
shown us the dire straits that many people in this world live in. We often lose
our will to act, to overcome the bystander effect, when we are so far away from
the problems that people face. Simply put, we cannot live in our progressive
western democracy, go to work in literal towering crystal spires, and
constantly think about "starving african children or whatever". 

There is huge cognitive dissonance here. If it meant getting our shoes dirty,
we would save a drowning child. If it meant getting on a plane and flying
across the world, we would still save a drowning child. From both of these toy
examples we see that the duty to act is always there, regardless of moderate
personal damage (ruining clothes) or distance (flying there). How do we get
from the high level ethical breakdown in which we are honorbound to act, to
what is implemented as fundamental apathy?

Don't get me wrong, I am not condemning the very human focus on the local over
the global, but one of my personal goals is to act efficiently in the service
of global issues. Ergo, my life mission adds two intertwined goals. First, I
want to donate large amounts of money to extremely effective charities
(malaria and schistosomiasis intiatives), and, second, I want to share this
approach to charity, that we should prioritize giving to extremely effective
charities and that we have a duty to act in what ways we can.

## Becoming a Craftsman

My last main goal is more amoral. I get pleasure out of making cool things. I
take pride in the things I make. I have that peculiar affliction that I am
good at, and deeply love, being an Engineer. It comes back to that Greek idea of Arete, I want to
maximize my potential in this direction. I want to be the best Engineer I can
be. Solving cool problems for smart people.

I am a toolmaker. I seek to build the tools that enable others to maximize
their potential. In this way, I also establish my ripple. I want to smash the
barriers that people have by enabling them to take advantage of humankinds
shared incredible computational power. A life of service as a humble toolmaker,
is a life I will not regret.

# Success, Happiness, and Meaning

## Why are these separate?

With so much discussion of the fundamental problems of being human, it is easy
to focus on semantics, pinning down the meanings of words. How many times have
my classmates stopped our teacher, Tony, and asked him to "define this word
you're using, exactly". The problem is fundamental to language and more exposed
when we try to talk about abstract but very personal subjects. Success,
Happiness, and Meaning are all inextricable. Even these words we use only
crudely set a first order approximation of the problem domain. If words and
models are our maps and the ground truth of our desire is the territory, it is
painfully obvious that the map is not the territory. I choose these three
categories as the brute separation of this territory, to be holistic in this
discussion will muddy the waters (if they are not already fevered ramblings). 

## Success

### What is Success?

Success is the feeling we get when we take pride in the fruits of our labors.

As we've covered in class, a sufficient second order approximation of success
can be in the following components:

- Happiness
- Achievement
- Significance 
- Legacy

"Now wait a minute George", you might ask, "Why is happiness here and also
covered later. That seems redundant." And to that I say that you're right...
kinda. Happiness is a component of success, but in this domain it is focused on
the element of enjoying the fruits of your work. The tomatoes you grow yourself
always seem to taste better to you, but could honestly be replaced by store
bought and anyone else wouldn't notice.

Achievement is how the success feels in a more visceral sense. It is the
feeling of pride when you make it to the summit. Even if the view is obfuscated
by fog, even if it is frigid, you can't help feel a sense of satisfaction from
conquering this mountain. It is the feeling of **winning**.

Significance is that benefit that your success has to your tribe. How much
profit did your project produce for the company? How fulfilling is it to see
that student you helped turn around and ace her computer architecture midterm?

Legacy is how your success lasts. When you create your sculpture, your magnum
opus, is it made of q-tips and twine? or wraught steel and hard stone? How will
your success survive and thrive? We want our successes to not be destroyed in
front of us. We want the code we write to be a pivotal benefit to a system that
will keep chugging long after you may have left the company. 

### How do you measure it?

We can thus measure our success more easily by measuring the constituent
components. 

We measure achievement by how many of our goals we accomplish, by
how difficult it was to accomplish them, and comparing them to the goals of
others. 

I'll focus on measuring happiness later, as much of that discussion applies
here.

Legacy and significance are harder nuts to crack. You can imagine why the
average Duke student may not focus on these as components of her success.
They're far less *real* to us. They require a worldy wisdom to see as products
of our labor. 

Measuring significance is often not up to us, but on the people who we work
for. The appreciation of the people that our work benefits us set the terms for
seeing our actions' significance. 

Our legacy is not something that we can see moving forward, these dots are only
connected looking back on our life's random walk. Legacy is like concrete. It
get's stronger the longer it has set, reaching peak strength years after the
pour. The roman sewers and aquaducts were lasting success, but we know this
only long after their society collapsed. Time has the final word on our legacy.

### Why chase it?

Why should we chase success? Is it that warm feeling, that hedonic motivation
that makes us search out and carve our success into the mural of human
civilization. I feel at a loss for words how to describe this. I want to have
some higher reason for my craving success. The materialistic explanation is all
I can fall back on. The stupid, beautiful, and simple answer is that we chase success because it feels
good. Being successful means surviving the night and finding a good mate.
Success is therefore a key fuel in our motivation engine, but success alone
cannot drive us forever.

## Happiness

### What is it?

Happiness can, too, be broken up into sub-components:

- Joy is that immediate pleasure. Those butterflies in our stomach. The
  overwhelming sense of ecstasy.
- Contentment is that slow burn of gratitude. The sense of rightness and
  harmony in the world.

### How do you measure it?

The simplest way to measure your happiness is to count the frequency of
*butterflies*. It is that fire in your belly that speaks to you. It does lead
to a bit of experimental error, for when we look for the ways that happiness
appears in our life, we open ourselves to more of it, overestimating its base
occurence. 

It is easy, for most, to recognize ecstatic moments, but it is oft harder to
recognize effective contentment. The feeling of being more than alright with
the state of our world is fleeting if you are so focused on **The Next Big
Thing**. To be content, an atomic component of happiness, is to be in deep
gratitude to the circumstances of our life, both those that we have worked to
achieve and those we had the raw luck to be given.

### Why chase it?

For the same reasons that we chase success, we chase our happiness. Happiness
is more difficult to produce than success however. Where we can work to chase
success and be rewarded, chasing happiness often has the exact opposite effect.
Happiness is an occasional beneficial side effect of chasing success, but it
can also open itself up to you when you least expect it. If anything, happiness
is the heat produced by our motivation engine burning success and meaning in
different ratios. 

## Meaning

### What is it?

Paul Tillich, in his seminal work on the phenomenology of religion "The
Dynamics of Faith", spoke of our religious motivation engine. Humans crave
ultimate fulfillment, to do so we engage with our ultimate concern and the risk
that our concern is idolatrous (i.e. worshipping a false idol and receiveing no
such fulfillment). Meaning is our fulfillment produced by our success.

On first glance, it seems that meaning could be represented by the success
components of Significance and Legacy. To that I say once again, you're
right... kinda. They are in the same territory, but something about meaning
cannot be reducible to success. Ultimate fulfillment is a product of our
purpose and drive. Meaning is both the lens and crucible to interpret our
success and turn it into what drives us.

### How do you measure it?

The question reduces to how do we see meaning in our lives. What do we see in
those who live with high meaning? Brooks would say that they have chosen the
path of service to others and to the world. 

I have to punt the ball on this one. Like the supreme court's definition of
pornography, "I'll know it when I see it". This, I think, is a binary issue. You can
either feel fulfilled by what you are doing or not. You can be fulfilled in
some silos of life more than in others, but within each silo, if you are true
to yourself, the answer is in your gut.

### Why chase it?

These answers must be getting boring to you by now. It's the same as it always
has been. We chase meaning because the feeling of being fulfilled is a
different kind of wonderful. It is the last fuel in our motivation engine a
distillate effect of refining our sucess through a focus on fulfillment.

# Moral Fiber

## Primer on Integrity

For this section, it is useful to understand what I mean when I say integrity.
I mean it as the sweet spot where our actions overlap with our intentions.

![Integrity = Overlap of Intention and Action](src/Integrity.png){width=400}

## Moral Role Models

I have always learned to be a better person by the quality of my company. Those
I most admire are those I most stand to learn from. There is something about
everyone that I can admire and want to copy and assimilate into my being. I
have simply too many role models to list, but I can attempt to list the
categories of those people whom I admire.

- Immense, Raw Empathy
- Absolute Kindness
- Humility
- Generosity
- Strong-Heartedness and the Moral Courage to Act

Those same categories I list for my role models, are those traits that are the
largest delta growth opportunities for myself. I often feel that I behave in
cocky, cold, and lukewarm way. All of my role models have rock solid
integrity; they act in the way they believe they should and have the "Heart of
a Lion" that drives them to be true to themselves.

## Moral System

### Touchstone Principles

### Moral Compass

### Moral Code

## My Character

My character is built from fundamental traits and principles. Many of these are
strengths, and many of my strengths have shadow sides from their logical
terminus. Here I try to list those that are indeed fundamental to my core
character, those principles I live and die by.

# Amoral Fiber 

## Master your Craft

I mention this in my life mission, but it's worth going into why I value
mastering my craft. 

Making things feels good. It's visceral. The satisfaction at making a desk with
your hands and your tools. The joy of getting my system set up to convert this
leadership map from plain text documents into the format you see here right
now. Making things, even better if they solve a problem, is a shortcut to
direct achievement and satisfaction. 

I've made some cool stuff in my life:

- EMP generator that can shut off small electronics.
- Standing desk from pallet wood for my freshman dorm room 
- Programs to help my classmates with grunt work on our final projects
- Papercraft masks for halloween
- Metal and glass flower pot sculpture

These fulfill my creative urge. Literally the desire to create, but also the
desire to express myself. 

I've always enjoyed making things; I'm not sure where it originated. I can't
remember a time when I haven't enjoyed manipulating physical medium. Even in
grade school my art projects existed in physical space, penny nails on a wood
board adding texture to a water color.

When it comes to mastering my craft, I feel there's also an element of
recognition from my peers. I love making a creative product but the icing to
this cake is that community validation that comes from making something people
value.  

## Learn, Learn, Learn

Reportedly, this was the advice Lenin gave to young people, and it holds true
today. I have a deep curiosity and hunger for learning. It feels so good to
grapple with a novel concept. I enjoy more than anything sharing my knowledge
with others. I love seeing the glint of clarity and understanding in someone's
eyes just as much as experiencing it myself.

Beyond academic learning, I value self-knowledge. We harken back to the words
of Socrates: 

> The unexamined life is not worth living 

The benefits of self-awareness are many. To live in accordance with your
values, you must first know your values. This is not to say that I am a very
self aware person. Like so many areas of expertise, the less you have the more
likely you are to overestimate your ability. Suffice to say, I am just on the
cusp of self-awareness, enough to realize all the work I need to do.

## Being Less Wrong More Often

### What this means

I value having true beliefs. 

This may sound odd, but I believe it is important that my understanding of the
world is correct to the best of my ability. It presupposes the existence of
ground truth (because, lets be honest, we wouldn't look both ways at crosswalks
if we thought truth was completely subjective). If there is ground truth out
there, then why should we not try to shape our beliefs to be closest to
reality? 

### Radical Epistemic Humility

Being less wrong is about embracing being wrong as a stepping stone towards
being right. This approach is radically empirical. It means divorcing my ego
completely from my predictive beliefs. This is **very hard**. I fail at this
consistently. It means you have to seek out those ideas that radically
challenge yours, face them openly, and seriously entertain whether they are
true. Evaluating beliefs on their merit means potentially believing very
unsavory perspectives if they This is where my openness to experience is
stretched and tested.  fit the evidence better. It's painful and alienating for
the people around you.  But at the end of the day, the truth is worth holding.

## Shortcoming: Developing Discipline  

An amoral virtue I feel the need to cultivate is that of Discipline. So much of
the success, curiosity, and passion that drive me are fickle in their source.
They could not carry me through a winter. They are useful tools but are
capricious. Discipline, for me at least, is an undeveloped muscle. I often fail
to hold myself to deadlines, to do what I said I will do by the time I said I
would, and when the going gets tough to be tough enough to keep going.

If I could be more disciplined, I would be better able to manage my time and
accomplish the goals that matter to me when passion for them is no longer
enough to see it through. 

# Leadership Qualities

I am not a driver. I am not a dictator. Where I excel is in motivating others,
and in helping people remove their blockers. In this section I hope to
elaborate on the ways in which I am best able to lead and those areas
where I can most stand to get better.

## Lead from the Rear

I feel most comfortable doing what I call, leading from the rear. It means
listening to your squad, understanding where they want to go, and helping them
realize the path to their success. It's flipping the script on traditional
leadership. Instead of the team depending on you, you depend on your team.
Instead of leading your team, you follow them, and enable them to achieve the
success they determine. This is not control, this is trust. 

## Lead by Example

I feel at home in the trenches. I'm detail oriented in the extreme. In that
same way that I love the craft, I love being on the front line with someone on
my right and left working on the problem. I'm a poor delegator, but a good
doer. 

The way I lead is by setting the high water line of what work should be. If you
want your community to act the way you want them to, you must first act the way
you want them to. If you set the standard, others will follow.  

## Implementation: P-WILD and Non-Directive Leadership

Twice a year, for every year of my Undergrad, I helped with a program called
Project WILD (Wilderness Initiative for Learning at Duke). On August we take
groups of 7-8 incoming freshman and 2-3 staffers. On March we take 3-4 crew
members and 2-3 staffers. Over two trips as a participant, and 6 trips as a
Staffer. The primary leadership style, the high water mark, was non-directive
leadership.

Let's unpack that term. To be non-directive is a combination of these leading
from the rear and leading by example. As a staffer, you have a fundamental
expertise of the problem domain. You've been on these trips, you know how to
rig a tarp and cook a meal in the woods. You are a resource for these crew
members, but they can easily come to rely on you. The goal of a non-directive
leader is to build your crew's competencies to the point they no longer need
you. This a difficult path to thread, as you need to balance support with
challenge. The crew needs to learn, and in order to learn they need to suffer.
If you always act as a safety net for your crew they will not learn the skills
they need to become good staffers in turn. Programmatically this means they
make the same mistakes we did as crew members, but we learn best from our own
mistakes.

## Sheep vs. Goats

My approach to leadership can be illuminated by a metaphor:

> “The merest accident of microgeography had meant that the first man to hear the
> voice of Om, and who gave Om his view of humans, was a shepherd and not a
> goatherd. They have quite different ways of looking at the world, and the whole
> of history might have been different. For sheep are stupid, and have to be
> driven. But goats are intelligent, and need to be led.”
> - Terry Pratchett

Let me elaborate and interpret this statement. Mild disclaimer, I know nothing
about the actual animal husbandry, so please take this metaphor with a block of
salt.

### The Shepard and The Drove

It is somewhat problematic to refer to people as sheep, but what I want to
focus on is the approach of the shepherd. The shepard drives the flock. Another
name for a sheep collective is literally a **Drove**. What does this mean for
the community. It means the sheep are driven by the stick. The sheep are in a
state of stress, forced to move to the places the shepherd wants them to. 

This is inherently against my strengths. I don't have a vision of where we
should go. I don't have the will to force my team in the direction I choose. I
am more of a goatherd.

### The Goatherd and the Tribe

Goats are stubborn. They are smart. They know what they want and can fight to
get it. The collective noun for goats is **Tribe**. These are my kind of
people. Goats cannot be driven, they need to be influenced. There is a trust in
the tribe, and not every team will have this. The goatherd is a member of the
team, in service to the team.  

## Growth Opportunities - Trade Offs of Gentle Leadership

There are deep trade-offs in this approach though. As a technical leader in the
trenches, I can lose the forest for the trees. It prioritizes tactics over
strategy. And it depends fundamentally on the mutual trust of you and your
team.

I feel that I am passing the buck on taking a stand. This style of leadership
is go with the flow; the tree that bends survives the hurricane. What should I
do when the time is not to bend but to hold fast, to double down on what
matters? 

## Growth Opportunities - Personal Competency Worksheet 

After filling out my core competencies worksheet, I found the following areas
needed the most development.

- Taking action, making decisions, and following through
- Managing conflict and negotiating
- Time management

Notice a theme? I find that I too often bend when I should hold steady. I need
to learn to hold myself and others around me more accountable. Planning my time
so that I am more equipped to follow through on my commitments is fundamental.
I need to be true to myself and true to my word. I've mentioned this before,
but I am a deep people pleaser, sometimes at the cost of my own integrity. This
needs to change. 

# Twenties Journey: Objective, Direction, and Path

It may seem paradoxical, but I am simultaneously sitting at a pivotal moment
and given a set of, in the long run, meaningless choices. The values I build
and cement in the first chunk of my adult life will stay with me as I move
forward. In the words of Joseph Campbell, as I join the adult world I switch
from a relationship of dependence to a relationship of independence, and
finally to a relationship of people depending on me. 

I am 23, I have spent my last 23 years in education system, with only a brief
foray into working as a coop student (6 months) and interning (2 months). I
have 8 months of reasonable adult experience. I sit at the precipice of a sea
change, a complete shift to self reliance where I no longer depend on my
parents income nor the communities built up by my schools and childhood
interests. This is a defining decade for the man I want to become.

Yet I can't help but remember Robert Frost's poem, "The Road Not Taken". The
poems protagonist comes to a fork in the road, and chooses a path. In what is
perhaps the most misunderstood poem in American popular thought, the meaning of
the poem is not that taking the road less traveled made all the difference, but
that the protagonist is rationalizing the future impact of what seems like a
weighty decision. The choices I make for my first job or city. Many choices
turn out to be irrelevant stumblings on my path.
